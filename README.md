## How It Works

Rant Stranger Note App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application's structure and styling are defined using HTML and CSS, while JavaScript handles the interactive functionality, such as creating, displaying, and deleting notes, as well as managing local storage.

The app leverages the Pico.css framework to provide a consistent and visually appealing experience across different devices and screen sizes. The responsive grid layout for displaying notes is achieved through CSS Grid.

When you add a new note, the app creates a new HTML element representing the note card and appends it to the grid container. Simultaneously, the note data is stored in the browser's local storage for persistence. When you delete a note, the corresponding HTML element is removed from the DOM, and the note data is removed from local storage.

## Getting Started

To use Rant Stranger Note App, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. The app is ready to use out of the box, without the need for any additional setup or dependencies.

Start adding your thoughts, rants, and ideas by clicking the "+" button in the navigation bar. Fill in the topic and note content, then click "Add Note" to create a new note card. To delete a note, click the trash bin icon on the corresponding note card.
